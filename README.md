# Credit_risk_prediction
##   utilized different learning algorithms including KNN, Logistic regression, decision tree, and the popular XGBoost to find the best algorithms, and on top of that.
## implemented RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to fine tune the hyperparamters and further improve the model.
## The final model has a 0.939 accuracy score and 0.957 AUROC score.
